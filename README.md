# GhostieMarkov

A Discord bot written using Python 3.6 and the wrapper [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite). Ghostie generates random responses based on the data mined, as well as the keywords used in your trigger sentence.


## Steps before you can run it
1) Create a `token.txt` file in the data folder, which will contain your generated token
2) Create a `responses.txt` file in the data folder or just let the bot log the sentences from your server

## Conversing with the bot
To get it to respond to you must have `ghostie` inputed somewhere in your message. Otherwise the bot will just be passively logging every other message.

## Example response
**Warning:** Can be sassy or depressing at times
